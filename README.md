Climate Change Forecast - SARIMA Model Overview This project aims to forecast climate change patterns using a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. The SARIMA model is a time series forecasting technique that incorporates seasonality, trend, and external factors to predict future values.

Data The project utilizes historical climate data sourced from [insert data source]. The dataset includes [describe dataset content, e.g., temperature, precipitation, CO2 levels] recorded over a specific time period.

Methodology Data Preprocessing: The raw data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure uniform time intervals. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the underlying patterns, seasonality, and trends present in the data. Model Selection: SARIMA model was chosen due to its ability to capture both seasonal and non-seasonal patterns in time series data. Model Training: The SARIMA model was trained on a subset of the data, and parameters were tuned using techniques such as grid search or auto ARIMA. Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Forecasting: Finally, the trained SARIMA model was used to forecast future climate change patterns. Results The SARIMA model demonstrated promising results in forecasting climate change patterns. The forecasts show [describe key findings, e.g., increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns] over the forecast horizon.
